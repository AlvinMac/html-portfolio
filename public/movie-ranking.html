<h1>The Best Movies by Me</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>This movie is my prime favorite movie out of everything I've seen. It's a perfect movie for me. The fight scenes are intense,
    the actors are fantastic, the music, the themes, etc. Everything in this movie is a good experience. The only negative I can 
    find that would apply is it lasts too long. Doesn't bother me if a movie goes on for 4+ hours, as long as it's good. </p>

<h3>Batman: Under the Red Hood</h3>
<p>This movie was my most favorite movie to watch when I was younger. It had a great story, interesting characters, and superb
    voice acting. Overall, a 10/10 movie that I think anyong can enjoy.</p>

<h3>Train to Busan</h3>
<p>My last favorite movie for this list would be this korean zombie movie. I love watching zombie stuff, but I find most of the
    modern-American zombie media to be bland. I liked their early 2000s and 60's to 90's more. However, the recently been enjoying
    the korean's take on the zombie genre. They're style of filming a zombie movie feels so refreshing. They bring lots of emotion
    into each scene. The characters are all quite unique as korean culture is completely different to American one. Hence, having 
    them imprint their culture on the movie through the usage of clothing, theme, language, etc. was all very entertaining for me.</p>
